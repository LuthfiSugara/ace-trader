Example: If your starting balance is $100,000, you can drawdown to $92,000 before you would violate the Maximum Trailing Drawdown rule. Then for example let's say you take your account to $102,000 in CLOSED BALANCE. This is your new high-water mark, which would mean your new Maximum Trailing Drawdown would be $94,000. Next, let's say you take your account to $106,000 in CLOSED BALANCE, which would be your new high-water mark. At this point your Maximum Trailing Drawdown would be locked in at your starting balance of $100,000. So, regardless of how high your account goes, you would only breach this rule if your account drew back down to $100,000 (note, you could still violate the daily drawdown). For example, if you take your account to $170,000, as long as you do not drawdown more than 5% in any given day, you would only breach if your account equity reaches $100,000.</p>"

In this scenario, you will receive $12,800 and we would retain $3200. This would also take the balance of the account down to $104,000, and your Maximum Trailing Drawdown is locked in at $100,000. So, you would have $4,000 maximum you could lose on the account before it would violate the Maximum Trailing Drawdown rule. If you take a full withdrawal of the gains in your Funded Account, the Maximum Trailing Drawdown will lock in at the starting balance and trigger the Maximum Trailing Drawdown breach rule, resulting in the forfeiture of your Funded Account.</p>"
