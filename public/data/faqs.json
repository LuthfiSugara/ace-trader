Example: if your prior day's end of day balance (5pm EST) was $100,000, your account would violate the daily stop loss limit if your equity reached $95,000 during the day. If your floating equity is +$5,000 on a $100,000 account, your new- day (5pm EST) max loss is based on your balance from the previous day ($100,000).

                "<p>The Maximum Trailing Drawdown is initially set at 8% and trails (using CLOSED BALANCE - NOT equity) your account until you have achieved a 5% return in your account. Once you have achieved a 5% return, the Maximum Trailing Drawdown no longer trails and is permanently locked in at your starting balance. Example: If your starting balance is $100,000, you can drawdown to $92,000 before you would violate the Maximum Trailing Drawdown rule. Then for example let's say you take your account to $102,000 in CLOSED BALANCE. This is your new high-water mark, which would mean your new Maximum Trailing Drawdown would be $94,000. Next, let's say you take your account to $106,000 in CLOSED BALANCE, which would be your new high-water mark. At this point your Maximum Trailing Drawdown would be locked in at your starting balance of $100,000. So, regardless of how high your account goes, you would only breach this rule if your account drew back down to $100,000 (note, you could still violate the daily drawdown). For example, if you take your account to $170,000, as long as you do not drawdown more than 5% in any given day, you would only breach if your account equity reaches $100,000.</p>"
