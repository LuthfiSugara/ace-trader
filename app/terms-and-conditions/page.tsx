                <p className='text-2xl font-bold'>Prohibited Uses</p>

                    <ul className='list-disc ml-6'>
                        <li>Exploiting errors or latency in the pricing and/or platform(s) provided by the Broker</li>
                        <li>Utilizing non-public and/or insider information</li>
                        <li>Front-running of trades placed elsewhere</li>
                        <li>Trading in any way that jeopardizes the relationship that the Company has with a broker or may result in the canceling of trades</li>
                        <li>Trading in any way that creates regulatory issues for the Broker</li>
                        <li>Utilizing any third-party strategy, off-the-shelf strategy or one marketed to pass challenge accounts</li>
                        <li>Utilizing one strategy to pass an assessment and then utilizing a different strategy in a funded account, as determined by the Company in cooperation with the Company at its discretion</li>
                        <li>Attempting to arbitrage an assessment account with another account with the Company or any third-party company, as determined by the Company in its sole and absolute discretion.</li>
                        <li>Opening a position within 3 minutes before or after a News Event is prohibited. Any traders identified as having opened a position during a News Event are subject to having that position closed and the associated P&L removed from their account, having the leverage on their account reduced or having their account breached altogether. The Company has sole and absolute discretion in determining what constitutes a News Event.  This rule is intended to protect the integrity of our program and is not meant to penalize traders who inadvertently trade through a news event.</li>
                        <li>Attempting to arbitrage your account with another account with the Company or any third-party company, as determined by the Company in its sole and absolute discretion.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <p>If the Company detects that your trading constitutes Prohibited Trading, your participation in the program will be terminated and may include forfeiture of any fees paid to the Company or owed to you by the Company, in the Company’s sole discretion. Additionally, and before any Trader shall receive a funded account, the trading activity of the Trader under these Terms and Conditions shall be reviewed by both the Company and the Broker to determine whether such trading activity constitutes Prohibited Trading. In the case of Prohibited Trading, the Trader shall not receive a funded account.</p>

                <p>Additionally, the Company reserves the right to disallow or block any Trader from participating in the program for any reason, in the Company’s sole and absolute discretion.</p>

                <p className='text-2xl font-bold'>Prohibition of Gambling Practices:</p>
                
                <p>Engaging in inappropriate risk management practices, such as gambling, “all-in” trading, or excessively leveraging positions, is strictly prohibited. Trading activity that resembles gambling—such as consistently placing trades prior to news releases or other binary events—will not be tolerated.</p>

                <p>Excessive risk-taking and gambling are defined by the percentage of an account risked in a single trade or across a series of trades or positions. An “all-in” trade refers to committing all or a substantial portion of available capital or margin to a single trade. Similarly, excessive and improper use of leverage occurs when a trader risks a significant portion of their account in one trade or across a series of one-directional trades and positions.</p>

                <p>If you are found to be engaging in such activities, the Company reserves the right to immediately close your account and such closure may include the forfeiture of any fees owed to you by the Company, in the Company’s sole discretion.</p>

                <p className='text-2xl font-bold'>Copy Trading</p>

                <p>Copy trading from one account to another is only permitted if the trader owns all the accounts in question.</p>

                <p>Group trading, signal services, passing services, or any other methods that bypass individual strategy are not allowed.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>Engaging in trades that mirror or closely align with another trader or group of traders across multiple accounts is strictly prohibited.</p>
                    <p>Using automated trading systems (EAs) or third-party trading strategies that facilitate copy trading is strictly prohibited</p>
                </div>

                <p className='text-2xl font-bold'>Reverse Trading/Group Hedging</p>

                <p>Hedging or executing reverse trades within a single account is not a prohibited trading activity.</p>
                <p>Executing a buy trade on one account and a sell trade on another account, or vice versa, is strictly prohibited.</p>
                <p>Group hedging across multiple accounts and/or coordinating opposing positions at one or multiple prop firms practice is strictly prohibited.</p>

                <p className='text-2xl font-bold'>Education</p>
                
                <p>The Company does not provide any trader education. The intent of The Company is to identify individuals with a talent for trading. No live trading is provided directly by the Company. Such Traders who pass an assessment offered by the Company shall be allocated capital to trade in a live account under the terms of the Trader Agreement.</p>
                <p>Although The Company may provide data, information, and content relating to investment approaches and opportunities to make trades, such data, information and content is provided solely for general informational and educational purposes. The Company does not invite the Trader to take any action based upon any of the information and materials provided on by the Company; you should not construe any such data, information, or content as investment, financial, tax, legal, or other kind of advice.</p>
                <div>
                    <p>The Company further does not make any representations that any data, information, and content on the Company website is accurate or complete. You alone will bear the sole responsibility of evaluating the merits and risks associated with using any such data, information, and content. As such, you agree not to hold the Company liable for any possible claims of damages that may arise from any decision that you make based upon the use of data, information, and content on the Company website.</p>
                    <p>While the Company does not provide you with the opportunity to invest actual currency, the Company wants to make sure you understand the risks involved with traditional investing. You should be aware that the risk of trading and investing is high and substantial. It can work for you as well as against you. It may or may not lead to substantial losses. Additionally, past performance is not indicative of future results.</p>
                    <p>As such, you should carefully consider whether trading and investing is right for you depending on your investment objectives, level of experience, and risk appetite. If you are unsure, you should consult with a financial advisor and/or tax advisor.</p>

                <p className='text-2xl font-bold'>Purchases and Refunds</p>

We make no representation or warranty in relation to third party prizes provided and to the fullest extent permitted by law, The Company shall have no liability to you in relation to any prize, its fitness for purposes, merchantability or otherwise. </p>

                <p className='text-2xl font-bold'>Guidelines</p>

                <p>The Company will display the guidelines associated with the Services on the Company’s website and via email, upon becoming a Trader. These guidelines, which may change from time to time in The Company’s sole discretion, are incorporated in whole into this Agreement. The Company makes absolutely no promise, guarantee, or warranty, express or implied, as to any promise to future employment as a trader, monetary payments, or any other type or kind of compensation or award for your performance as a Trader.</p>

                <p className='text-2xl font-bold'>Evaluation Limits</p>
                <div>
                    <p>You are permitted to purchase and participate in <strong>only one</strong> evaluation of a specific account size and a specific plan type at a time, regardless of trading platform. </p>
                    <ul className='list-disc ml-6'>
                        <li><strong>Example:</strong> You can have one 100k One Step Plan and one 100k Two Step Plan active, simultaneously. However, you cannot have one 100k One Step Plan on DXtrade and another 100k One Step Plan, regardless of platform.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <p>A maximum of $1 million in active evaluation plans per person is permitted. This can be composed of multiple assessments.</p>

                <p className='text-2xl font-bold'>Commissions and Fees</p>

                <p>Commissions or commission-equivalents may be charged in connection with your trading activity. Rates and methods of application can vary by asset class and are determined by our liquidity providers, and may be adjusted periodically to reflect market conditions. In addition, it’s important to note that positions held overnight may incur swap rates. These rates vary by asset class and are subject to change.</p>

                <p className='text-2xl font-bold'>Margin</p>

                <p>While our current leverages and margin requirements are fixed, we reserve the right to implement tiered or variable margin requirements at our discretion, and such changes may be made without prior notice.</p>

                <p className='text-2xl font-bold'>Liquidity Providers</p>

                <div>
                    <p>We utilize an aggregate source of pricing and liquidity from multiple brokers and liquidity providers. The current liquidity providers use a number of different tier 1 banks, prime brokers, market makers and other liquidity sources to derive their pricing, and those underlying liquidity providers change constantly.  Aggregating liquidity providers while maintaining multiple sources of liquidity allows us to provide competitive pricing and execution, while reducing reliance on a sole liquidity provider.</p>
                    <p>All market pricing and trade executions are provided by the brokers, without any alterations or modifications on our part.  Moreover, we do not adjust transaction costs such as bid-offer spreads, markups/markdowns or swaps beyond what is set by our brokers.</p>
                </div>

                <p>Please note that the composition of liquidity providers may vary depending on the platform.</p>

                <p className='text-2xl font-bold'>Disclosure Statement</p>

                <p>Before deciding to participate in financial markets, you should carefully consider your investment objectives, level of experience and risk appetite. Most importantly, do not invest money you cannot afford to lose.</p>

                <p>Moreover, the leveraged nature of over-the-counter trading means that any market movement will have an equally proportional effect on your funds. This may work against you as well as for you.</p>
