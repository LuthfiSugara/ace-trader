                                    <p>For example, we may use these cookies to store your session information to prevent others from changing your password without your username and password or remember your cookie preferences.</p>

These particular session cookies expire quickly — at most after 24 hours — and any data associated with them becomes anonymous at that time. Because they are essential, they may be active from the moment you access the website. However, if you wish, you can disable them — see the “Your Choices” section below.</p>
